# Get Attachments From Certain Subfolders In outlook

### Problem: I needed to get all the BOLs (Bill of Lading) for certain truck drivers. The problem is that each driver has his own Outlook subfolder and a bol subfolder under that. This script identifies the correct subfolder and downloads the BOLs for each driver. **Saving 50 hours.**

This is not production code by stretch of the imagination. It's just a quick and dirty script to get a one off thing done.
